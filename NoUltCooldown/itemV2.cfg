This mod removes the cooldown for all ultimates, ensuring that purple bar is full at all times!

Cooldowns can be enabled/disabled or their length modified in the <F4> mod menu. 

Note: The cooldown length won't go any higher than their vanilla cooldowns (e.g. setting 100 seconds on Waystalker's ult defaults down to vanilla 70 seconds). I can change this to allow longer cooldowns if people really want this feature as well.

While optional, I also suggest subscribing to \"Neuter Ult Effects\" by prop joe if you don't want to lag your computer when spammning certain ults: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1384066089";
